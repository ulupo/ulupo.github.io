I dabble in protein language models and their applications to [protein-protein interactions and multimer structure prediction](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.14.553209),
[de novo protein sequence generation](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79854), and [phylogenetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34032-y).

I have written and/or maintained several [open-source software libraries](/repositories) in topological machine learning.

My PhD was on [algebraic quantum field theory on curved spacetimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tieYcLniCd8), which is a general and mathematically rigorous approach to quantization on arbitrary spacetimes.
